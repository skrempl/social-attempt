This is my first project, and I guarantee you I will need help, and I heard GitHub can be good for getting help as a new coder. I am using Django.
My current issue is that my command prompt giving me a "ModuleNotFound" error, stating that "No module named 'core.urls'"
I am trying to follow this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSUm6iMtREA&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org and am stuck at about the 21 minute mark because my page (http://127.0.0.1:8000/) refuses to connect when I have completed his steps. Any help is appreciated, and please let me know if I need to include more details! Total rookie.
